# Contributing to the PineNote Ecosystem

## Introduction

The software side of the PineNote is purely community driven.
It follows that all aspects of this software ecosystem needs help, to varying
degrees.

In the following some long-standing themes are discussed. However, if you are
willing to actively help, please drop into the PineNote chat on
matrix/irc/telegram (see
[wiki.pine64.org](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/Main_Page#Chat_Platforms) ).

## What open issues are there?

This is mostly an documentation issue, and information is widely scattered
between the chat, the wiki, and the repositories containing the various parts
of the Debian image.  While in the end all general issues for the PineNote
should be collected and managed in the wiki, for now a first point of contact
is the issue tracker of the Debian image: https://github.com/PNDeb/pinenote-debian-image/issues
Here you will also find some meta issues that hopefully provide you with
enough information to tackle your issues, or find a place to contribute.

## Documentation

This is always an issue. User-side documentation can always use help. Usually
it's best if you try to contribute to this documentation by improving aspects
that you found difficult to follow, or topics that you think are important, but
are completely missing from the documentation.

Traditionally, technical, as well as user-focussed, information can be found in
the [Pine wiki](https://wiki.pine64.org/wiki/Main_Page).
However, the PineNote comes with a separate user manual (this document you are
reading right now), which resides in this github
[repository](https://github.com/PNDeb/pinenote-tweaks/tree/main/pn_handbook).

Issues and pull-requests are very welcome!

If you want to improve the technical documentation, it's best to focus on the
wiki (linked above).

## Upstreaming

There are active, ongoing, efforts to upstream missing driver parts for the
PineNote to the official kernel. If you want to help, please get in touch via
the chat.
