# Getting Started with the PineNote

<!-- First point of contact, should give just enough to know whats what and setup someone who has used Linux before -->

Welcome to your new PineNote, we hope you enjoy the experience of using the PineNote.
The PineNote comes loaded with a community maintained Debian based distribution that has been pre-configured for a reasonble starting point.
Of course, you are welcome to customise your device to suit _you_.

## Introduction

The Pinenote debian should be fairly self explanatory, but there is a new menu in the top bar of gnome that controls the ePaper display.
The display can render high quality greyscale but due to the technology this makes updates slower, as the screen does more refreshes and flickering.
This menu allows rapidly changing mode to suit what you are doing on the device.

The screen features a Wacom digitiser for the pen input, and this is supported out of the box.

### WiFi & Bluetooth
<!-- TODO -->
The PineNote can be connected to WiFi by using the menu in the top right hand corner, and then tapping on the WiFi symbol.
Bluetooth also works as expected and shows up in this menu. This will allow you to pair keyboards and other peripherals to the device.

### Updates
<!-- TODO -->
As the current operating system is Debian, the command line update tool is `apt` but also the GUI program "Software" can be used to pull updates.
Where possible the OS is kept as close to upstream Debian, so everything should feel about the same.

### ePaper modes
<!-- TODO, need to check the names on the device -->



### Thank you

Finally, this software distribution is bought to you by Maximilian who has tirelessly worked away and making this experience as polished as possible.
There have also been huge contributions by Samuel Holland and others who have created the upstream ePaper driver that is used for this screen.
